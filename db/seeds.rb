        Chorus Innovations is a fast-growing healthcare technology company with a no-code PaaS that enables anyone to visually create mobile, text messaging and interactive voice apps. Chorus’ unique and powerful platform is currently being used by doctors, researchers, patients and community stakeholders alike to power transformative healthcare, biomedical research and community improvement projects across dozens of institutions and public health agencies worldwide.
        
        We are hiring a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer that can help manage the complexity of our PaaS. We need a developer that is experienced in frontend and backend, and can work with other roles on the team, including developers, PMs, designers, QA, and customers. The team is working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, but we require working in our LA office after the pandemic period.
        
        Our development stack includes CoffeeScript, AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, MySQL, Redis, and Solr. We welcome new technologies that solve problems and are open to other frameworks.
        
         
        
        About You
        
        You have experience developing complex web applications. You are highly proficient with full-stack web development, ideally including CSS, HTML, JavaScript or TypeScript, a newer frontend framework (e.g React), Ruby on Rails, and MySQL. Experience with other languages or technologies are welcome.
        
        You see yourself as a professional software engineer. Your background can include a CS degree, a non-technical degree, or maybe you are self-taught.
        
        Communication and empathy are important. Internally, you will be working with many roles required to build, deliver and operate a complex system. Your work needs to be communicated effectively to the entire team, not just to other engineers. Externally, the system’s user interface will be used by diverse communities. Usability and accessibility of the system needs to be considered in all decisions.
        
        You will find comfort in working in an environment with multiple feedback loops. Before implementing solutions, you document and discuss with the team. Your code is reviewed by other engineers, either through pair programming or code reviews. You write automated tests describing how the system works. You work with QA on acceptance and regression testing, and not just throw it over the wall. After delivery to production, you assist with monitoring and fixing issues that arise.
        
        As an early hire, we look for you to help us improve our software development process, build our future teams, and be a pillar for the company’s culture. You are a team player who has the wisdom to lead and teach and the humility to follow and learn.",
